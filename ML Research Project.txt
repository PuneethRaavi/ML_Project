Project Question
	Can we predict financial inclusion in India—measured by whether individuals have a bank account or use digital payments—using socioeconomic and demographic characteristics?

Objectives
	•	To identify the key demographic and socioeconomic drivers of financial inclusion in India.
	•	To compare the performance of traditional econometric models (Logistic Regression) with machine learning models (ExtraTrees, AdaBoost).
	•	To provide insights into which groups remain excluded from formal financial services.

Methods
	•	Dataset: India subsample from the World Bank Global Findex 2021 database.
	•	Preprocessing: Data cleaning, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables.
	•	Models:
	•	Logistic Regression (baseline, interpretable).
	•	Ensemble ML models: ExtraTrees, AdaBoost.
	•	Evaluation: Classification accuracy, ROC-AUC, and feature importance ranking.

Expected Outputs
	•	A predictive model for financial inclusion at the individual level.
	•	Feature importance analysis showing which socioeconomic factors (e.g., income, gender, education, employment, rural/urban) drive inclusion.
	•	Policy-oriented recommendations for improving financial access in underrepresented groups.

Partners
	•	Data Provider: World Bank (Global Findex database).
	•	Research Context: This project is independent, but findings align with financial inclusion goals of the Reserve Bank of India, NITI Aayog, and financial policymakers.

Dataset
	•	Rows (observations): 3,000
	•	Columns (variables): 119

Key Variables (first few)
	Demographics:
	•	female (1 = female, 2 = male)
	•	age
	•	educ (education level)
	•	inc_q (income quintile, 1–5)
	•	emp_in (employment status)
	•	urbanicity_f2f (urban/rural)
	Financial Inclusion (potential targets):
	•	account → Has any financial institution account (Yes/No)
	•	account_fin → Has an account at a financial institution
	•	account_mob → Has a mobile money account
	•	anydigpayment → Has made a digital payment
	•	merchantpay_dig → Made a digital payment to merchants
	Other financial behaviors:
	•	receive_wages, receive_transfers, receive_pension, pay_utilities, remittances
	•	mobileowner, internetaccess

Good Target Variable Candidates
	•	account → baseline measure of financial inclusion (has an account or not).
	•	anydigpayment → digital financial inclusion (binary).
	•	account_mob → mobile money adoption.

Target Variable (Dependent)
	account → whether an individual in India has any financial account (bank, mobile, or other).
	Reason:
	•	It’s the core indicator of financial inclusion.
	•	Binary classification problem → fits Logistic Regression, ExtraTrees, AdaBoost.
	•	Policy-relevant (Reserve Bank of India & World Bank use this measure).

Predictor Variables (Independent)
We’ll use a mix of demographic, socioeconomic, and access-related variables:
	Demographics
	•	female (gender)
	•	age
	•	educ (education level)
	Socioeconomic
	•	inc_q (income quintile)
	•	emp_in (employment status)
	•	urbanicity_f2f (urban vs rural)
	Technology / Access
	•	mobileowner (owns a mobile phone)
	•	internetaccess (internet availability)
	Financial Behavior (past year)
    •	saved 
    •	borrowed 
	•	pay_utilities
	•	remittances
	•	receive_wages
	•	receive_transfers
    •	receive_pension
    •	receive_agriculture
